# Google Ads Negative Keywords Pipeline
This tool helps Google Ads advertisers automatically process large volumes of search query reports to identify and filter out irrelevant traffic.
The pipeline utilizes OpenAI API to analyze search terms and generate comprehensive lists of negative keywords based on specific exclusion criteria.
The solution addresses a common challenge where advertisers need to process millions of search queries monthly but cannot effectively do this through ChatGPT interface due to input limitations.
The system works by breaking down large search query lists into manageable batches, processing them through OpenAI API with carefully crafted prompts, and combining the results into a clean list of negative keywords.
Each search query is evaluated against multiple criteria including geographical relevance, service type match, DIY intentions, competitor brand mentions, and budget-related indicators.
The negative keywords generated by this pipeline can be directly imported into Google Ads campaigns, saving hours of manual review work.
Our pipeline supports both one-time processing of historical data and ongoing analysis of new search queries as they accumulate.
The implementation follows best practices for working with OpenAI API, including efficient token usage, proper error handling, and rate limiting compliance.
The project is structured to be easily adaptable for different business types and filtering criteria while maintaining high performance with large datasets.
