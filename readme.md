# Google Ads Negative Keywords Pipeline
- This tool helps Google Ads advertisers automatically process large volumes of search query reports to identify and filter out irrelevant traffic.  
- The pipeline utilizes OpenAI API to analyze search terms and generate comprehensive lists of negative keywords based on specific exclusion criteria.  
- The solution addresses a common challenge where advertisers need to process millions of search queries monthly but cannot effectively do this through ChatGPT interface due to input limitations.  
- The system works by breaking down large search query lists into manageable batches, processing them through OpenAI API with carefully crafted prompts, and combining the results into a clean list of negative keywords.  
- Each search query is evaluated against multiple criteria including geographical relevance, service type match, DIY intentions, competitor brand mentions, and budget-related indicators.  
- The negative keywords generated by this pipeline can be directly imported into Google Ads campaigns, saving hours of manual review work.
